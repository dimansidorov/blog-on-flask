# Blog-project 

My pet-project is a blog web application built with Flask that allows users to create accounts, log in, create, edit, and delete their blog posts. The application includes user authentication and registration, profile management, post publication, and user roles and permissions. The responsive design and search functionality make it easy for users to browse and find posts.
